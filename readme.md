# Cork
Cork is a simple bulletin board web app.

This project is mainly an excuse to review and practice concepts covered in class and learn about best practices when collaborating with other developers (eg. more in-depth use of `git`, GitHub features, posting issues, etc.). Hopefully we end up with a decent app while learning about the practice of software engineering as a whole (more or less).

## Basic App Functionality
- The main feature of this app is the main page that shows a grid of excerpted posts (like a bulletin board...).
    - Clicking on a post excerpt will show it in full
    - If user is author of post, they are able to edit or delete it
- On the main page, user can add a new post.
    - User clicks on a button, which will bring them to a "compose post" page (like any other apps of this kind)
- A post consists of a subject line and the main content (all text only for now)

That's it for now, but a wireframe could be helpful.

## Initial Project Guidelines
In general, start small and simpleâ€”we can always complexify the project as we move forward. This may not be the most efficient way of building something from scratch, but that's not really the point. 

Guidelines by categories are now in [a separate file](https://github.com/jtanadi/cork/blob/master/guidelines.md)
